I get it, on 13/03 Etsy [sent an email](https://www.reddit.com/r/EtsySellers/comments/1bda0fj/forcing_changes_to_delivery_schedule_so_what_if_i/) to the store owners asking them to start having "Saturday & Sunday" to their processing schedule, and it is irking some store owners and they are asking if they should Migrate from Shopify to Etsy. I have an answer that may be a *possibles* solution.

And for Etsy, this is nothing new actually. They have been doing it for a long time. The question arises if you should just *move to Shopify instead?* Let's discuss it for a bit.

## Why should you move from Etsy to Shopify?

There are a lot of reasons actually, but here are the top 4 reasons why you need to move from Etsy to Shopify

1. You get the control of your own customer list.
    
2. You get the freedom of having your own Shipping times.
    
3. You pay *less fees* and have more freedom.
    
4. Less competition for star seller or any badge.
    

**It's too good to be true Nikhil, what's the catch?** The catch is having a Shopify store and running it is a bit complicated.. you get to take take care of a lot of things!

## Shopify vs Etsy (cons)

Shopify is an awesome platform, but with great power comes great responsibility. It's not an easy task if you are coming from a non-techy background as Shopify is a lot of work.

1. You bring traffic by yourself. (unlike Etsy)
    
2. You take care of payment gateways, disputes. (unlike Etsy)
    
3. You take care of the sales, the discounts and the store design.
    
4. Shopify needs a good theme, and design to convert better
