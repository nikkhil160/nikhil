[I do ecommerce marketing for Shopify](https://nikhil.pro/how-we-made-100k-in-less-than-a-month-using-facebook-ads), but I have been getting a lot of messages from my North American clients asking me if I can run Facebook Ads for Bakery which made me think if I can help small-business owners in running their own Facebook Ads (like a pro!)

First let's look at what others are doing, they can be your competitors or biggies in the market.

### List of the Top 3 North American Cookie Brands

1. Crumbl Cookies
    
2. Insomnia Cookies
    
3. Sprinkles Cupcakes
    

**How Crumbl Cookies runs their Facebook ads?**

Crumbl Cookies uses a traffic/conversion objective to divert people to their website where they can see the location and the users that has clicked the ad can be retargeted back. Crumble cookies also use Facebook's pixel-based retargeting. ([see all Crumble Cookie ads](https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?active_status=all&ad_type=all&country=US&view_all_page_id=864630237035029&sort_data%5Bdirection%5D=desc&sort_data%5Bmode%5D=relevancy_monthly_grouped&search_type=page&media_type=all))

Insomnia Cookies uses Facebook Ads with Purchase objective to generate online orders for their online store, unlike Crumbl Cookies - Insomnia Cookies focuses more on the online website of the business and gives various offers like VALDAY24 that gives FREE DELIVERY ([see all **Insomnia Cookie** ads](https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?active_status=all&ad_type=all&country=US&view_all_page_id=154198687954817&sort_data%5Bdirection%5D=desc&sort_data%5Bmode%5D=relevancy_monthly_grouped&search_type=page&media_type=all))

Just like Insomnia Cookies, Sprinkles Cupcakes also focuses on the online website ordering instead of having people drive to their offline stores. Sprinkles Cupcakes uses Facebook Ads and Facebook Pixel to target, track and remarket the visitors for better conversion rate. ([see all **Sprinkles Cupcakes** ads](https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?active_status=all&ad_type=all&country=US&view_all_page_id=40028693028&sort_data%5Bdirection%5D=desc&sort_data%5Bmode%5D=relevancy_monthly_grouped&search_type=page&media_type=all))

### Using Facebook Ad Library to See Competitors Ads

How did I see those ads? Facebook has a tool called [Facebook Ad Library](https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?active_status=all&ad_type=political_and_issue_ads&country=US&sort_data%5Bdirection%5D=desc&sort_data%5Bmode%5D=relevancy_monthly_grouped&media_type=all) that can be used to search if any page is running ads, or what ads they are running. I used the Facebook Ads Library to check what ads they are running.

1. **Facebook Messenger Ads:** You can run Facebook Messenger Ads for your business and can setup an autoresponder that automatically sends a greeting message to the user that has your store information in it. Example: *"Hello, Welcome to Crumbl Cookies, we are located in 1195 3rd Ave New York, New York 10021 and we operate from 11AM to 8PM"*
    
2. **Instagram Follow Ads:** Instagram doesn't have an Instagram Follow objective but you can use Instagram Traffic objective ads to generate traffic for your Instagram page that encourages users to follow the bakery's Instagram account, building a larger and more engaged audience.
    
3. **Website Direction Ads:** Just like [Crumbl Cookies](https://crumblcookies.com/), if you have a website, you can link your Facebook Pixel and create a traffic objective or pageview objective to have people visit your website and get the directions.
    
4. **Facebook Page Likes Ads:** This is a very simple and straightforward objective that can be used, just like Instagram Follow Ads you can run ads for your Facebook Page and generate engagement that can be used to drive footfall in your bakery.
    
5. **WhatsApp Ads:** WhatsApp ads for bakeries are new and very common, you can use WhatsApp ads to facilitate a communication between your customers and can use [WhatsApp catalogue](https://faq.whatsapp.com/833697274483076/?cms_platform=web) to enable direct ordering from WhatsApp itself
