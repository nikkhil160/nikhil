What is happening? Everyone is trying to bang their head on the wall. Meta (formerly Facebook) is on a rollercoaster right now, especially after late June of 2023.

I was doing a fairly good ROAS until June, all my LAAs were working well, they used to give 10-12X ROAS on normal days, and used to get tons of engagements on my posts.

**Why are Meta (formerly Facebook) Ads unstable in January 2024?**  
There has been no official communication from Meta but everyone is saying that they are unstable after Facebook released its new Ad Delivery platform called [Meta Lattice](https://ai.meta.com/blog/ai-ads-performance-efficiency-meta-lattice/).

**What is the problem with Meta (formerly Facebook) Ads in January 2024?**

The problem is they are insanely expensive, the CPMs that used to be under $10 are now double or even triple. The cost per click that used to be under 0.30 is now $1 with absolutely trash traffic.

Multiple advertisers including Sean Frank from Ridge and David Herrmann from Herrmann Digital are reporting the instability issue of Meta Ads. There is a subreddit called [r/FacebookAds](https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAds/) on Reddit that has a ton of posts with regards to the instability of Meta Ads.

If you are a small e-commerce business owner then I would suggest going with interest targeting, remember that you should watch your metrics very carefully. Always know what you are doing.
