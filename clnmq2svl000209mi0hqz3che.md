What is happening? Everyone is trying to bang their head on the wall. Meta (formerly Facebook) is on a rollercoaster right now, especially after late June of 2023.

I was doing a fairly good ROAS until June, all my LAAs were working well, they used to give 10-12X ROAS on normal days, and used to get tons of engagements on my posts.

**Why are Facebook Ads not performing in 2024?**  
There has been no official communication from Meta but everyone is saying that they are unstable after Facebook released its new Ad Delivery platform called [Meta Lattice](https://ai.meta.com/blog/ai-ads-performance-efficiency-meta-lattice/).

**What is the issue with Formerly Facebook Ads?**

The problem is they are insanely expensive, the CPMs that used to be under $10 are now double or even triple. The cost per click that used to be under 0.30 is now $1 with absolutely trash traffic.

## **Who is else reporting the unstable performance of Facebook Ads?**
