I know why you're here. Most likely, you visited a website where the integration of Calendly with Google Analytics too confusing. You've come to the right place.

In this article, I will cover the easiest way to track Calendly or Tally events on Meta and Google Ads.

**We're not using a thank you page because many users leave it before it fully loads.**

I'm going to get straight to the point and list all the steps over here.

## Setting up Calendly with Google Analytics

### Step 1: Setup Calendly with Google Analytics

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1713183038839/5d0c167b-99c4-4b8c-9461-7d623aef143b.png align="center")

Go To Calendly &gt; Integrations &gt; Google Analytics and when you're here, you need to enter your Google Tag ID, which you'll obtain from your Google Analytics dashboard.

### Step 2: Verify Calendly is linked to Google Analytics

Go to Google Analytics &gt; Admin &gt; Data Collection and Modification &gt; Data Streams and ensure it indicates '***Data collection is active in the past 48 hours***.'

### Step 3: Verify Calendly Events on Google Analytics

Now, go to Google Analytics &gt; Admin &gt; Data Display &gt; Events.

Calendly has five important events that we need to focus on, and you have to ensure that the following events appear on the events page.

* **invitee\_event\_type\_page**
    
* **invitee\_meeting\_scheduled**
    
* **invitee\_scheduling\_page**
    
* **invitee\_select\_day**
    
* **invitee\_select\_time**
    

Don't worry if they don't show up immediately, as it takes some time for the events to appear. Just **make sure that you trigger the events by scheduling a meeting after setting up Google Analytics.**

We have to focus on the **invitee\_meeting\_scheduled** as this is the last page which also means that the meeting has been scheduled, and we only want to track the scheduled meetings.

### Step 4: Set Calendly Event as 'Conversion' on Google Analytics

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1713184393271/89b7fc52-4ba3-44b8-9ca9-3567b9e79eba.png align="center")

Once you see the Calendly events in Google Analytics, you need to set "**invitee\_meeting\_scheduled**" as a conversion by checking the checkbox next to it.

That's it for Google Analytics.

Now, let's move on to Google Ads and connect Google Analytics with Google Ads.

## Importing Calendly events into Google Ads

### Step 1: Connect Google Analytics 4 to Google Ads

Go to **Google Ads &gt; Tools &gt; Data Manager &gt; Connect a Product** and connect your Google Analytics 4 with Google Ads, this has your invitee\_meeting\_scheduled that we will need later on.

### Step 2: Import Calendly Events to Google Ads

To Import Calendly events to Google Ads, go to Google Ads &gt; Goals &gt; Summary

Click on '**New conversion action**,' then click on 'Import' to import data from Google Analytics or other sources. Select Google Analytics 4 properties, then 'web'.

Here, you will see the Google Analytics event called invitee\_meeting\_scheduled that we marked on Step 3.

To verify Calendly event on Google Ads, just go to Google Ads &gt; Goals &gt; Summary and you will see the imported invitee\_meeting\_scheduled event and the status will be active.
